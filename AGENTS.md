# AGENTS.md

This project is governed by the Quaternion Media constitution, vendored at
`governance/qm` (a submodule pinned to this project's `project/qmetronome`
branch of that repo). If you are an AI coding agent opening this repo with
no other briefing, read this file fully before your first commit or edit.

## Before you do anything

1. Read `governance/qm/README.md` and `governance/qm/PRINCIPLES.md` in full
   — the namespaces/precedence rules and the charter. Both are short.
2. This project's own decision records live in `governance/qm/adr/` — inside
   the submodule, on this project's own branch, not at this repo's root — as
   `ADR-NNNN` (numbered locally, at ratification) or `DRAFT-*.md` before
   ratification. A human ratifies; you draft.
3. **Everything you produce arrives as a pull request.** Work on a branch and
   open a PR for human review — in this repo, and in the `governance/qm`
   submodule when you touch this project's records there. Never commit to,
   merge into, or push a shared branch directly, and never merge your own
   work, however small or mechanical the change looks. If you cannot open a
   PR, hand the branch back rather than merging it.
4. **Human-only contributorship applies to every commit you make here** (see
   `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-human-only-contributorship.md`): do not add
   yourself, your model name, or any co-author trailer naming an unmonitored
   address (e.g. a vendor `noreply@` address) to any commit. If your default
   tooling normally appends a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer, suppress it for
   this repo. Tool involvement is disclosed as a `Tools:` note where the
   artifact calls for one, never as a byline.
5. Follow the drafting-session handoff contract in
   `governance/qm/adr/README.md` before writing or amending any record.
6. A QM record may be tightened by this project's own records, never
   relaxed — see `governance/qm/README.md`'s "Namespaces and precedence."
7. Banned in any pre-ratification `DRAFT-*.md` record: "previously",
   "originally", "earlier draft", "re-review", "renumber", "retroactive",
   "supersedes the ... (stance|finding)", "corrected". Drafts are rewritten
   in place, not narrated. The ADR lint enforces this over prose only, so
   quoting the list in a code span is fine.

## One-time setup on a fresh clone (Windows)

`CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are real symlinks to this
file, not copies — POSIX checkouts resolve them with no setup. On Windows,
enable Developer Mode (Settings → For developers) and run `git config
core.symlinks true` once per clone, then `git checkout -- .` if the files
were already checked out before that. Skipping this doesn't break
anything — the files degrade to one-line pointers containing just the
target path — but it isn't the intended, tested experience; see the
IDE-integrated governance discovery record in `governance/qm/records/` for
what was actually verified.

<!-- Project-specific setup commands, test commands, and conventions belong
     below this line; this seed only carries the governance-discovery part. -->

## Building and testing

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest --console=plain
```

Tests are the source of truth for the user guide and screenshots — see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Test coverage" section before adding or renaming one.
Every `Test` task carries a project-default timeout, per
`governance/qm/adr/DRAFT-enforced-test-timeouts.md`: a hung test fails rather
than being watched.
